Introduction

Information security is an important field in computer science. One of the oldest and simplest encryption methods is the Caesar Cipher, which was used to protect secret messages by shifting letters in the alphabet. This project presents a simple C++ program that encodes and decodes messages using this technique.
Project Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
To understand the basic concept of encryption and decryption.
To apply the Caesar Cipher algorithm in C++.
To practice using strings, loops, and conditional statements.
To correctly handle user input and output.
Description of the Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is based on shifting letters by a fixed number called the shift key.
Encoding shifts letters forward in the alphabet.
Decoding shifts letters backward using the same key.
Uppercase letters remain uppercase.
Lowercase letters remain lowercase.
Non-alphabetic characters such as spaces, numbers, and symbols are not modified.

Algorithm

splay a menu to choose encoding or decoding.
Ask the user to enter a text message.
Ask the user to enter a shift key (between 1 and 25).
Process each character of the message:
If it is a letter, apply the shift.
If it is not a letter, keep it unchanged.
Display the final encoded or decoded message.
Implementation in C++

CThe program is written in C++ and uses:
The string data type to store text.
A for loop to scan each character.
Conditional statements to check character ranges.
ASCII values and modulo operation to manage letter shifting and wrap-around.
This implementation ensures correct results for both uppercase and lowercase letters.


Exampl

eput Message:
HELLO WORLD
Shift Key:
3
Output (Encoded Message):
KHOOR ZRUOG
Using the same key to decode the message restores the original text.

Conclusion

Project demonstrates a simple and effective way to implement the Caesar Cipher using C++. Although this encryption method is not secure for modern systems, it is very useful for learning the basics of cryptography and programming. The project helps improve logical thinking and understanding of string manipulation in C++.
